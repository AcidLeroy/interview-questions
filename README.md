# Toy Problems for Interviews

Seems these days the only to land a job is if you know how to code all your favorite CS 101 algorithms. Since I don't deal 
with a lot of these algorithms on a day to day basis, I thought it would be fun to code them up in C++11 with my own style.
Most of the examples I find on the web these days are done in C or Java (bleh). Currently I only have binary search trees 
and graphs implemented, but I plan on adding more as time moves forward just because this is more fun than sudoku. I'm sure I 
made lots of mistakes, so if you want to hate, go ahead and put in a pull request and exclaim your genius to me.
